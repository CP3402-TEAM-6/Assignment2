# Project Overview
We made a website about BAIZONN LEARNING CENTER in wordpress for this project, which was done by students of James Cook University's class of 2022 CP3402. The work on this project, which was done by a small group of external students during their studies, was one of our most important projects of the semester, and our group was fully committed to this task.

# Repository Contents
In the process of creating this website, we use wordpress to enhance and decorate our website, making our website more useful and enjoyable.

# Port Configuration

Wordpress - 80
Phpmyadmin - 8080
Once you have the container running, you should be able to access the Wordpress and Phpmyadmin through these links. Accessing the Wordpress admin can be done here. When developing locally with the local .env, the username and password for Wordpress are both wordpress. Phpmyadmin uses root and password for its username and password respectively.
